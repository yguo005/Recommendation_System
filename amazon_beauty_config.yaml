# Convert ratings to implicit feedback (0/1)
# Any rating > 0 is considered as positive interaction

# Evaluation metrics
  # Recall: how many of the true relevant items are recovered in the top‑K.
  # NDCG: position-aware score; higher if correct items are ranked near the top.
  # MRR: average of 1/rank of the first relevant item.
  # Hit: whether at least one relevant item appears in top‑K.
  # Precision: fraction of recommended items that are actually relevant.
metrics: ['Recall', 'NDCG', 'MRR', 'Hit', 'Precision']
